The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can cause unexpected results due to unexpected operator precedence or unit mismatch. For instance, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10%);` can be problematic depending on the parent element's size and whether the percentage is calculated correctly.  Another issue arises when mixing different units without explicit conversion (e.g., `calc(100px + 5em)`).
